1. Fast Order:

Workflow:
1) Create fast order from Product Page. It is available on some products.
2) Button "Fast Order" opens POPUP.
3) POPUP shows fields: "Name", "Email", "Phone", "Message" - that is opened fields
4) Product ID, Customer ID (if logged in) - is hidden fields

Warnings for myself:
1) Do not forget about created_at and updated_at
2) Foreign Keys on product_id and fast_order


Future Features:

1) Convert fast order to real order in admin
2) Apply discount if fast order - on convertation
3) Select different rules on different conditions if fast order

Need to do:
1. Email notification on Fast Order Create event
2. Feature for sending mail from admin to customer
3.
