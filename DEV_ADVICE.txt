1. If you have PHPStorm trouble like: "Namespace name doesn't match the PSR-0/PSR-4 project structure":
* Go to Settings -> Directories
* Add that module to "Content Root" as other correct modules, and add namespace "Ipotseluev\FastOrder"


2. To reinstall something:

DROP TABLE: drop table fast_order;
DROP ALL MIGRATIONS: delete from migration where class like '%FastOrder%';

3. To debug CLI (docker-off environment):
(use alias instead):
XDEBUG_CONFIG=idekey=PHPSTORM bin/console database:migrate --all IpotseluevFastOrder


4. Here you can debug FOREIGN_KEY troubles:
vendor/shopware/core/Framework/DataAbstractionLayer/FieldSerializer/AbstractFieldSerializer.php:

protected function validate

Saving there:
vendor/doctrine/dbal/src/Driver/PDO/Connection.php
public function exec(string $sql): int


5. bin/console ipotseluev:fast-order:create --product_number SWDEMO1000  <<TAB , just press TAB :)
That is autocomplete

Command default:

bin/console ipotseluev:fast-order:create --product_number SWDEMO10006 --customer_name "Some One Two" --customer_phone "+7999" --customer_email "ans"
bin/console ipotseluev:fast-order:list


6. To remove custom field for product:
(it will delete all dependencies like custom_field an relations)
delete from custom_field_set where name = 'fast_order_set';

7. If you want to know - how data goes to the page, you should look here:

vendor/shopware/storefront/Controller/ProductController.php
$page = $this->productPageLoader->load($request, $context);

$page contains Product. Product contains customFields.
So, no special thing. If you want to add something from yourself, like buttonText - probably
you need to add eventListener (or subsrciber) to push it to $page.

8. If you want to understand how ajax form submits and past the data:

_onAfterAjaxSubmit - in all.js

Or

0)vendor/shopware/storefront/Resources/app/storefront/src/main.js - a lot of stuff
1) vendor/shopware/storefront/Resources/app/storefront/src/plugin/forms/form-ajax-submit.plugin.js -> _onAfterAjaxSubmit

9)

vendor/shopware/core/Framework/DataAbstractionLayer/CompiledFieldCollection.php - autoload on getBasicFields

You need to addAssociations to Criteria to get joined fields


10) To optimize admin style building:

export DISABLE_ADMIN_COMPILATION_TYPECHECK=1
export SHOPWARE_ADMIN_BUILD_ONLY_EXTENSIONS=1
export PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=1
